# Design Document: Chatbot Integration

## Overview

This design document outlines the implementation approach for integrating a Langflow chatbot into the AZU musician website. The chatbot will be fixed at the bottom right corner of the website and will be responsive across different platforms and devices. The implementation will ensure that the chatbot is always accessible to users regardless of which page section they're viewing, while maintaining the website's visual style and performance.

## Architecture

The chatbot integration will follow a client-side implementation approach, leveraging the Langflow Embedded Chat JavaScript library. The architecture consists of:

1. **Langflow Embedded Chat Library**: A third-party JavaScript library that provides the chatbot functionality.
2. **CSS Styling**: Custom CSS to position and style the chatbot according to the website's design language.
3. **HTML Integration**: Embedding the chatbot component in the website's HTML structure.
4. **Responsive Design**: Media queries to ensure proper display across different devices.

## Components and Interfaces

### Langflow Chat Component

The primary component is the `<langflow-chat>` custom element provided by the Langflow Embedded Chat library. This component handles:

- Chat interface rendering
- Communication with the Langflow backend
- Message history management
- User input processing

The component requires the following configuration attributes:
- `window_title`: The title displayed in the chat window header
- `flow_id`: The unique identifier for the Langflow flow to use
- `host_url`: The URL of the Langflow backend server

### CSS Styling Component

A dedicated CSS component will be created to:
- Position the chatbot at the bottom right corner
- Ensure the chatbot remains fixed during scrolling
- Apply responsive styling for different screen sizes
- Add visual styling that matches the website's amber and dark theme
- Handle transitions and animations

## Data Models

The chatbot integration does not require specific data models as it relies on the Langflow backend for data processing and storage. The communication between the frontend and backend is handled by the Langflow Embedded Chat library.

## Error Handling

The implementation will include the following error handling strategies:

1. **Script Loading Error**: If the Langflow script fails to load, the website should continue to function normally without the chatbot.
2. **Connection Error**: If the chatbot cannot connect to the Langflow backend, it should display an appropriate error message without affecting the rest of the website.
3. **Rendering Error**: If there are issues with rendering the chatbot UI, the component should gracefully fail without disrupting the user experience.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will include:

1. **Cross-browser Testing**: Verify that the chatbot works correctly in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
2. **Responsive Testing**: Test the chatbot on various screen sizes and devices to ensure proper responsiveness.
3. **Performance Testing**: Ensure that the chatbot integration does not significantly impact the website's loading time or performance.
4. **Functional Testing**: Verify that the chatbot correctly connects to the Langflow backend and provides appropriate responses.

## Implementation Details

### HTML Integration

The Langflow chatbot will be integrated into the website by adding the following code to the HTML body:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/logspace-ai/langflow-embedded-chat@v1.0.7/dist/build/static/js/bundle.min.js"></script>
<langflow-chat
  window_title="Basic Prompting"
  flow_id="32d5675c-693b-4c8d-9f2b-1632c01ea692"
  host_url="http://localhost:7860">
</langflow-chat>
```

### CSS Styling

The chatbot will be styled using the following CSS approach:

```css
langflow-chat {
  position: fixed !important;
  bottom: 24px;
  right: 24px;
  z-index: 9999;
  max-width: 100vw;
  width: 350px;
  min-width: 260px;
  height: 520px;
  box-shadow: 0 6px 32px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.25);
  border-radius: 1rem;
}

@media (max-width: 640px) {
  langflow-chat {
    right: 8px;
    bottom: 8px;
    width: 98vw;
    min-width: 0;
    height: 60vh;
    border-radius: 0.75rem;
  }
}
```

This CSS ensures that:
1. The chatbot is fixed at the bottom right corner
2. It has appropriate z-index to appear above other content
3. It has reasonable dimensions on desktop
4. It adapts to smaller screens with adjusted positioning and size

### Script Loading

The Langflow script will be loaded at the end of the HTML body to ensure it doesn't block the initial page rendering. This approach prioritizes the core website content loading before the chatbot functionality.

## Design Decisions and Rationales

1. **Fixed Positioning**: The chatbot uses fixed positioning to ensure it remains accessible regardless of page scrolling, providing consistent access to assistance.

2. **Responsive Design**: The chatbot adapts to different screen sizes using media queries, ensuring usability across devices without compromising the user experience.

3. **Z-index Priority**: A high z-index value (9999) ensures the chatbot appears above other page elements, preventing it from being hidden behind content.

4. **Shadow and Rounded Corners**: The design includes a subtle shadow and rounded corners to give the chatbot a modern, floating appearance that matches the website's aesthetic.

5. **Height Limitation on Mobile**: On mobile devices, the chatbot is limited to 60% of the viewport height to prevent it from dominating the screen.

6. **Minimal Configuration**: The implementation uses the minimal required configuration for the Langflow component to keep the integration simple and maintainable.
